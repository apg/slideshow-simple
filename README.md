# slideshow/simple

slideshow/simple is new reader to help quickly create slideshows for [Racket's Slideshow](https://docs.racket-lang.org/slideshow/index.html). It was originally inspired by [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent), but has expanded in capabilities beyond that of sent.

An example slideshow looks like this.

```
#lang slideshow/simple

slideshow/simple

!image.jpg

# comment line, ignored

Depends on...

- Racket
- Slideshow

slideshow FILENAME
\#lang slideshow/simple

\!IMAGE.png

thanks / questions?
```

It can be run like so:

```bash
$ slideshow filename.rkt
```

To add an image, use `!/path/to/image`, and to add a slide with some
text, just write some stuff followed by a blank line. Multiple lines
of text without blank lines will place all the text on a single slide.

A line that starts with a `#` character is completely ignored. If a
comment line comes immediately after an image, paragraph, quote, or
list the comment counts as a blank line, and a new slide will be
created for the next non blank/non comment line. The comment will 
become speaker notes.

A slide cannot contain both an image and text. Therefore, the
following slideshow is invalid:

```
#lang slideshow/simple

!image.jpg
foo bar baz quux
```

If a slide starts with a `\` the `\` is ignored. This allows escaping
literal `!IMAGE.png`, lines that would otherwise by treated as 
`# comments` comments`, and `\` literal escaped lines.

### Speaker Notes

As mentioned above, speaker notes get added to a slide when comments
are placed *directly* under your slide content:

```
#lang slideshow/simple

This is the slide
# These will show up as speaker notes.
# This will show up on the same slide.

```

### Lists

sent doesn't have lists, but they can be emulated by creating a
multi-line slide with bullets as the first character. In
slideshow/simple we've got bulleted, and numerical lists.

```
#lang slideshow/simple

1. We've
2. Got
3. Them.

- We've
- Got
- Them.
```

Note, though, that lists must be by themselves. There's no title
support, or additional paragraph support. This is considered a bug.

### Text Wrapping to fit.

Long lines will be wrapped to fit, rather than overrun the slide, or
be scaled to super tiny font sizes.

### Quotes

Quotes are popular in slides. slideshow/simple supports them.

```
#lang slideshow/simple

> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
> -- Wayne Gretzky
```

### Basic formatting.

There is none. We'll likely add monospace support, cause that'd be nice
for inline code.
